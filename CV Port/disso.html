	<p>		Hello, welcome to my dissertation about the rapiedly growing concept of the smart city.
			The growth around the Internet of Things is making cities more automated and more connected to each other. 
			This can be though of as an ease of use for the city to grow, but as I talk about in this paper it can also produce a city which lacks an identity and communiaty culture.

  <p>	
	This paper will discuss what a smart city is, and its fundamental problem, for which I propose a new use of the term 'Smart City'; using the humanistic approach from the creative city.
	Firstly, it will focus on the uses of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) within the smart city and discuss the changes affected by these new technologies.
	The Smart City uses these technologies in managerial terms and there is not enough research into how they can be applied to enhance the city’s identity and relationship with the public. By discussing the processes of a city’s need for a creative identity, it will ask why an engaging relationship with its occupants is important for the urbanicity of the city and outline new uses for the technologies.
	The paper talks more about the effects of a creative city; about how city identities are made and used as tools for attraction. To conclude, I will compare the Smart City and the Creative City against Canary Wharf, discussing their downfalls individually, but their gains when combined.
	The main focus is to expand on the application of the Smart City and see different urban design typologies for the future.

<button class="disso_writing">Introduction</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>		Smart cities are being implemented to manage the city in a way that enables a more networked flow around infrastructure within the area.  At the moment this is done purely in utility uses such as monitoring energy consumption or improving public congestion.  This needs to change, to be applied, not only through managerial terms, but in a way to make cities more individual, to create a city that improves the public’s relationship with each other and the city.  This will give a more societal meaning to the idea of community.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		When talking about the smart cities of the future, and somewhat of the present, there are advanced technologies that have the potential to be implemented into existing urban city infrastructures.  A big part of how this is going to be achieved is by utilising the emerging technologies from The Internet of Things (IoT), which gathers and makes data from physical objects and information communicative technologies (ICT), which can store and network data between connective technologies.  Using these new technologies, and reusing old ones for a different purpose to gather real-time data will give a better understanding of the cities and their citizens. The idea of having this interactive system in place for an individual to utilise and engage with the city, is one of the key discussion points in this dissertation. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Every individual is different which is interesting to consider when talking about the condition of how urban design engages with the public. This dissertation will discuss this theory of individuality in the context of David Yencken’s creative city ideology (Yencken, 1988). By, giving the outline of the creative city, this will then allow opportunities to compare his theories with the smart city. This will begin to explore the reality of this combination of community mixed with smart technologies.  Literature and theories developed since Yencken’s 1988 text such as his 2013 text (Yencken, 2013)  will also be considered to explore the research done on the need for creative cities, particularly in highly urbanised cultures. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Because Canary Wharf is a very functional and corporate area it has not grown much of a societal engagement with its occupants or has had the ability to build much of a relationship with the public. It is a manufactured city, which is growing out of financial power and greed - not cultural theories, but economic ones. This instigates societal stagnation and cultural indifference; but with the proposal of a technically advanced creative city this can start to develop a notion of individualism that engages a new relationship as well as keeping the power of the financial district.  The area of Canary Wharf will be studied in order to start an understanding of how specific technologies might be applied in a real context, which is currently not achieving its smart outlook and cannot be said to be creative. Technologies are a key part of the smart city; this dissertation will also be covering how both theories of the city would be applied to an area like Canary Wharf.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Due to its culturally Orwellian, dystopian-esque, corporate identity, it is both an easy and hard thing to talk about changing Canary Wharf. It may be easy to envision the Wharf as being a clean slate for the technological advanced proposal to make its way into the city.  But, it is also challenging to ask the question of what is needed to make it more engaging, change its purely corporate identity and what we can change without tearing the monochromatic buildings down.   Finally, this dissertation will give a better understanding of a different way in which a smart city can be implemented, by combining new technologies into a humanistic output.  It will present a new typology which can be integrated into the future vision for Canary Wharf.  It will consider how the ideas of both smart and creative cities can be merged to create a place where humanistic and technological approaches can form a new relationship for the benefit of the Wharf.

<div class="panel">
  <p>Siemens are part of the Genoa Smart City Association (GSCA) a municipality that is involved in transforming Genoa into the next big smart city.  Genoa is now being redeveloped with a new urban planning typology in mind for the city, because of the new smart city trend the Italian government has a new approach on how to go about developing it. “The economic and political actors that comprise GSCA are those in charge not only of “planning the city of the future” (GSCA website), the smart city utopia, but they also set the direction of public policies and public money (EU funds for smart cities projects).” (Grossi, G. Pianezzi, D, 2017, pg. 81). Grossi and Pianezzi view this style of city management as being very neoliberal. By letting companies interfere or make gains from the city it means that the government has handed over more power to corporations and gives them a more authoritarian control over this new smart city development.  The utopic neoliberal development of the smart city is a very critical argument but as for now I just wanted to show how invested Siemens are in the future of cities. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
“Siemens is a global powerhouse focusing on the areas of electrification, automation and digitalization. One of the world’s largest producers of energy-efficient, resource-saving technologies, Siemens is a leading supplier of systems for power generation and transmission as well as medical diagnosis. In infrastructure and industry solutions the company plays a pioneering role. “(Siemens – A Global Powerhouse, 2017).
  Siemens is a complex energy research facility that gets involved in a lot of sustainable projects, including launching a new urban smart city plan. In their short film Scenario: 2060 (Figure 2) they go on to explain what their smart city is and even write a story to go along side (Gold, S. 2015). In this video much of their urban planning is to do with the disappearance of cars and clean energy being produced by buildings, to decrease pollution of the city. They do however argue very heavily on the communication of different infrastructures of the city that gather ‘smart data’ from the city to make a more precise forecast for the city’s energy consumption (Zistl, S. 2017). Their argument combats the raising population of cities by developing new programmes to help with managing the city more efficiently, developing the city for the community, making everyone have a sustainable lifestyle to focus more time and energy in
 the societal culture. But as they speculate, and act on in Genoa, on this future of a new urban lifestyle, they do not offer any thought on the use of these technologies other than just to manage the city, this is also the case with Picon as seen in his book (mentioned later in chapter 2). This can be seen with their technologies that they are developing, that do not mention a bottom-up style of managing the city. Their urban future is meant to be a projection of such a place as Canary Wharf because when they speculate, (like many others) they think of a new clean city and do not take into account the identity already set in place.
		<br/>
		<br/>
The smart city offers technological advancements in much of the infrastructure management of the city, so when speaking about smart cities, it is easy to feel like they are stale and don’t do anything to improve the cultural indifference in certain areas.  Smart cities are a process of automation and, just like in any coded script, automation is only useful when the parameters are adjustable and right for the application.  Thus, when creative coding steps in, taking aside for the moment the notion of the city and analysing the nature of code, creative coding as an abstract way of making different physical outputs depending on appropriate parameters that you code into it.  Smart cities could be thought of in a similar way, and allowing for the parameters of the cities identity to fluctuate, we could manage the way the cities develop or let it enhance itself with its existing identity.  The way these parameters come about are from technologic advancements of data gatherers set in the city.  Gathering data that not only informs the parameters for the city, like public engagement or multi-cultural interactivity, but also informs the city with what should be implemented or improved on next in the city.  This style of the IoT should be gathered anonymously without much change happening to the existing buildings “The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.” (Weiser, M. 1991, pg 94). In an article for Scientific America, Mark Weiser states that the best technology is one that hides itself within the everyday, becoming the norm. This is what the theory of the IoT is doing. As data is invisible the only thing that needs to change is the way we gather the data, or the way we use it. “In the same way that Roman cities didn’t differ that much from modern ones. What will change, however, is the way we experience cities. ” (Gold, S. 2017). 
		<br/>
		<br/>
We already have a lot of data gathering communicative technologies, such as mobile phones and social media. A geo-locating project looking at people’s tweets and their locations after an event is a very interesting and useful way to gather certain data from the city.  This experiment was to show what people do at the event, before and after (figure 4) (Traumueller, Gkougkoustmos & Yimeng. 2013) and is an example of how to gather data of how people use the city, by seeing who went to the event and seeing where they go next or where they went before. By cross examining the tweets to see whether they did go to the event or not with where they are now, but only if they tweet.  This is one of the problems that might occur in this type of data gathering, which is why getting a neural-network to perform this cross-examination will increase the data gathered and help this gatherer scale-up in its use.  This gives just one example of how real-time data of the IoT could detect how the city is being used and what is needed to be implemented, or taken away, to improve the city. Helping city planners in the use of bottom-up techniques, by having a large amount of data to help highlight the uses and the problems with the city.

<button class="disso_writing">chapter 2: Debating the Smart city with the Creative city</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In this time of technological exponential growth, it is important for architecture not to be left behind, therefore there is a lot of momentum on the growth of the internet of things (IoT).  But the smart city, is not being considered in all its possibilities. It does not only have managerial applications. It is not only a piece of ingenuity that is rising fast in this age of technological automation (figure 5). The IoT has a lot of architectural applications that aren’t just functional but are a way to help the cities incorporate a more cultural agenda to the design of a city. A smart city can be used to gather data from the city and use that to manage the urban area with more ease and precision. The data gathered from the city is being implemented into the cities management of the utilities infrastructure; but this, IoT type of data, is not only applicable to the managerial process of the city but as a way to understand a city within its identity and help push a personalised agenda. 
<br/>
		<br/>
Antoine Picon, in his book Smart Cities: A Spatialised Intelligence, goes in depth into what a smart city proposes within the cities infrastructure and the individuals uses of the data in the city. He goes on to speak about the uses of the IoT and its relation to the smart city such as: the use for tracking public transport, to help the public manage their time; the use of augmented reality, to show information about different points of interests. Such things, which he proposes and researches into, are interesting in relation to the pragmatic uses of the data structure within the IoT, but in one section he points out a use for the IoT that I want to expand upon and add to the multiple uses of the IoT.  In this section he talks about the different relationships that are needed to construct a striving societal infrastructure in the city (Picon, A. 2015). For which Picon refers to David Yencken’s creative city. 
<br/>
		<br/>
Describing the creative city Yencken, in his short essay The Creative City, analyses the city as a network of socio-economic transactions between spatiality and individual relationships within the locational differences of the areas. This is heavily put across again when giving examples of “slum-clearing”, as he puts it, where the societal importance was not understood as a set of relationships. As this move happened the societal networks were not preserved but later it was found it would have been a great help to those in less accessible areas. He goes on to the emotionally engaging city, where he states that the individuality of a person is of such an importance in the urban culture and identity of the city (Yencken, D. 2013). His work has been written about a lot and this topic is still new to the contemporary, yet it does not mention the uses of new 21st century computer science technology. This shows that in this Information and Communication technologies (ICT) avant-garde era more research needs to go into looking at the tectonics that ICT could bring to the creative city. The IoT has the starting point of programming the city with a new technological standpoint, but unless we stop thinking of it in a managerial application and start thinking how we could use this real-time data, of city use, to start affecting the lives of the people living in these cities, there will always be a grid-lock on the smart cities as being secluded from more natural forms of the city, like the creative city.
<br/>
		<br/>
Adrian Bica, another architect who works with the community within a densely urban city, believes in an architecture that brings back the intimacy; designing to turn architecture into an emotionally narrative journey. He believes that the reductionist theories, led by the modernist movement, are to blame for the killing of architectural engagement. Stating that the emotion and the reactivity of architecture is no longer a huge concern in the design processes. “…things that are hard to measure are no longer a priority in the design of building” (TedxRyesonU. 2016) he goes on to give examples of the uses of technology to help show a perception of the city that excites an individual (Figure 6). He describes this emotional response type data, to the architecture, as imperative to gather, to help us better understand how architecture affects the public. But, his thoughts on the subject about bringing back the intimacy can be related to the notion of corporate architectures as branding. Architecture is now becoming an aspect of a company branding and is not designed in such a way that includes the cultural context of the societal city. “The contemporary economic landscape… has rendered this (historic architecture) local production of community identity largely mute. Globalization, efficient means of transporting materials, online exchanges about methodologies and techniques, and increasingly mobile workforces have simply erased the establishment of diverse individualized identities in regions, countries and cities. That is to say the world has become increasingly architecturally generic.” (Gage, M.F, 2016, pg. 290). Gage’s statement about the identity of the city is important to analyse because it tells us the importance of the city’s identity as a unique one and not one that should be replicated.  For now, I want to go into the problem with generic architecture and the aspect of a cultural indifference in this way of city planning. When talking about architecture as a form of branding, it becomes very hurtful to the social economics of said city, the design does not cater to the need of the city’s “Identity” but to its own corporate need. 
<br/>
		<br/>
The identity is very different in any location of mass urbanicity; thus, it is important to not only cater for the context but to introduce a new form of city planning.  The urban identity is made up from the societal culture that occupies it. Family owned shops that fit are set in the identity, independent designed shops that enhance the streets, relational markets that socially engage in the network surrounding them and independently designed public spaces, are just some of the kinds of ways that the city combines all these creative expressions into an identity for the city. This identity can be seen in London’s different districts, such as Camden markets diverse identity or Brixton’s rich multi-cultural pop vintage identity. The public like to occupy these areas because they are all different and offer a new outlook on the city and have evolved to fit with the people who work and live in these places; people like the era-defining houses or flats that change the areas aesthetic. There is an argument that new builds destroy the historic cultural identity; this may be true, but it only creates a new set of parameters for the identity to merge into, which I think is better for the enhancement and the continuation of the city, if done in a bottom-up style of planning. 
<br/>
		<br/>
  Creative cities, though, propose a new set of architectural guidelines for a design proposal. These guidelines offer a new typological language within a more contextual relationship with the identity of the city. Thus, cultural and individual design is a temperamental typology as it can fluctuate due to any number of societal shifts. The mergence with the managerial infrastructure and the new technology of the IoT, is key to the development and success of the new urban design strategy, that is the creative city. The individual, and city, produces a lot of data that can be gathered and collected for use in different types of ways (Figure 10). For example, using the internet makes use of this data; by tracking and monitoring your internet usage, it stores your history and key interests, based on 
your activity while surfing. This can then be used by advertisers to show adverts based on your interests.  This has been written about and advanced upon by Carl Pike in his thesis Pervasive Advertising and Robotics in the Public Realm, where he goes on to speculate about the advances in technologies to target adverts at us in the real world (Pike, C. 2014). This is an interesting topic, as it highlights the main aspect of a personalised city in relation to the speculation of drones and the use of the internet in the real world. But this might also be seen as one of its biggest downfalls, that the element of privacy becomes a big critique in the tracking and profiling of physical data extracted from one’s self. Technologies of the smart city can range in levels of privacy and amount of data gathered. Facial recognition has become big in the news, with china’s government wanting to use facial recognition as a profiling tool to track and allow the population to use their faces as ID. Sense Time is a small start-up facial recognition company in China who is working with the government to roll out this profiling tool (Wall Street Journal, 2017) (Figure 11). This use of technology strongly correlates to what the IoT is, the same with Pike above, and an extreme vision of what I am suggesting; as this technology 
would be a great way of changing the urban landscape for one’s subjective preferences, this is also very Orwellian and may end up changing the individual’s actions or preferences, which directly counters the humanistic creative city theory that I am comparing with.

<button class="disso_writing">chapter 3: Enhancing the identities of the city</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>	The city’s identity can come about in different ways, it can be deeply rooted in the areas history, it can come about naturally, or it can be implemented with strategically placed new development, to enhance the area and the public engagement. Some examples of these can be seen over London’s different urban landscapes. Camden can be seen to have a very deep-rooted history of having a culturally, creatively rich identity. Camden Town has a very developed identity, not only as a multi-cultural hotspot but as a societally creative place of urbanicity. Camden Town is an example of occupants in the area publicly expressing themselves. From designing their shopfronts, to selling handcrafted products at market stalls, this is an area that the creative class occupy. The creative class being a certain class of people that enhance the locations creative identity and make the area more identifiable as a place of culture. Richard Florida describes what sort of place it takes to attract the creative class. The three T’s being Technology, Tolerance and Talent (Florida, R. 2012); all three of these have been settled in the identity of Camden Town for a long time. There has been a lot of critique on his creative class theory, but I will be taking it as a source to compare to Camden’s identity, for this will add to my argument on why the identity is important for the occupants in the city. 
<br/>
		<br/>
  Talent has always been a part of Camden and one group who explored the societal modern urban culture became one of the main influences for the creativity of the area.  Before the war, in very late Victorian and Edwardian period, these influential innovative artists formed the Camden Group, “…this appellation choreographed a collective modernist identity that was emphatically tied to London’s working-class geography and was formed within and by the city’s social, artistic and commercial landscapes” (Stephenson, A, 2012). This new group would paint and write reflecting upon themselves and London with different social identities; as quoted, they chose north London because they were modernists that identified themselves as looking inward at London, its working class and the corresponding societal urban culture (Stephenson, A. 2012). Their work in and about London was a very important starting point in settling the Camden identity.  Their work would influence the area by changing the tectonics of Camden’s trajectory, into having a culturally diverse identity. This trajectory can be broken down into Florida’s three T’s, which the group brought. 
<br/>
		<br/>
Tolerance: can be said for the Camden Group in very positive or negative views. The group was heavily praised upon its depictions expressing the uniqueness of London’s social status as a culturally diverse metropolis. Having most of the members observing and often purposely tracking down a variety of bohemians in Europe, they enjoyed London’s rich multi-cultural landscape and had plenty of cultural understandings in different cultures. Although this brought about acceptance and inclusion there was one critical downside; that is that it was very homosocial and established one-sex grouping in which women were not allowed to partake, due to the rhetoric that it was an all-male avant-garde group (Sickert, W. 1911). The tolerance not only attracts the creative class, but is also forms a tighter relationship in the areas for the identity to grow. In the case for Camden, it formed an inclusive creative city. 
<br/>
		<br/>
Technology and Talent: can be talked about in parallel for this period of time; technology referring to the style and the style being part of the talent. Florida describes the Technology as “the level of high-tech understanding there is in the area” (Florida, R 2012, pg. 35); while Florida is talking about technology, his use of the word can be thought as an understanding of the time and the current trend. Going back to this trajectory coming from the Camden Group, the talent expressed in the avant-garde style of painting with society in mind, lead to setting up studios and exhibiting work in Camden and attracting many of those, who can be called the creative class, to migrate to north London and away from the already established creative cosmopolitan areas of London, such as Chelsea (Holt, Y. 2012). 
<br/>
		<br/>
  Camden is an example of an area which has formed and stuck with its identity for a long time. It is only enhanced upon by the groups of people and new communal infrastructures that have added to the growth and sustainability of this identity. Community engagement is key to the success of developing an identity, as a large part of Camden is the markets. While I was walking round the markets, I saw it as a hotspot for different cultures to display their creativity and build relationships in its communal society. Not only were people selling hand-made art, but they made their shop or market fronts independent from the rest (Figure 14); referring back to Gage’s text and the argument that independently created cities, or shops, form a stronger communal tie. Camden was for me a place that did this successfully, making the markets not only a place of business and a miniature economical society, but also a network of social connections that engage and develop relationships inside the area; this enhances the identity, and the identity attracts tourists and Florida’s creative class, ultimately helping the economy and helping it grow as a city. 
  In 2012 Brixton was awarded The Great Neighbourhood Award for independent businesses and markets thriving in the area, a place that struggled with criminal culture in the past is now a beginning to take back a multi-cultural significant identity (The Great Neighbourhood Award 2013, 2012).  With all the new businesses coming to Brixton, it needed a new space for these pop-ups, and a new area for communal relations to grow.  As for Brixton the implementation of a project has made the area grow its already creative and communally rich identity. Pop Brixton (Figure 15) posed to be a creative hub for the area, engaging the public with its independent shops, and gives the public more venues and gardens for their use (Future Brixton, 2014).  Brixton has been subjected to the implementation of a strategic design project for the city, by enhancing its already made identity which helped the area grow by listening and seeing what the 
public needed and wanted. These strategic ‘pop up’ projects can be seen to be a short promotion of a better relationship in these areas of division (with Brixton’s gentrification worries). 
Mould goes on about the Tactical Urbanism, and the uses of short pop up projects, in his book Urban Subversion and the Creative City (Mould, O. 2015).

<button class="disso_writing">Chapter 4: Canery Wharf's struggle to envoke an identity</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>
  In previous chapters, I have discussed the process of the smart city and the creative city as separate cities, arguing for and against a smart city and going into depth in what a creative city means. I want to now take on these two ideas and make them applicable to Canary Wharf, where it is hard to derive what the urban identity is trying to give to the community.  
<br/>
		<br/>
Canary Wharf can be heavily criticised for its corporate upbringing. Through a neoliberal Thatcher era, Canary Wharf was posed as a redevelopment of the old industrial ports, in the Isle of Dogs, transforming them into a new business district.  Its identity is one of a very corporate driven city. From the beginning of the redevelopment in late 1980s, to the constant buildings being erected presently, it has been seen to exclude the community, only having its first residential building built in 2014. This illustrates how canary Wharf is seen as a money driven area with minimal response to the societal impact it has to London as a whole.  “The east London office district is the base for more than 100,000 workers but the Newfoundland tower will contain the first purpose-built homes on the estate.” (Ruddick, G. 2014) (Figure 18). This quote from the Telegraph says something about Canary Wharf’s recent history and its identity for having no one living in any of the corporate tower blocks, that shadow the area, till 2018 means that there was no need for, or way that, a communal connection could embed itself into the corporate identity. The city has now been around long enough for a non-communal identity to settle, that is, by restricting the uses of the public spaces and ignoring uses of the public in non-commercial areas, this means it becomes hard for a healthy communal identity to be implemented into the corporate one.  Although, Canary Wharf Group’s (CGW) mission statement, about corporate responsibility, promoting inclusive growth, building communities and relationships, showing the municipality attempting to be all inclusive to 
the community (Hirigoyen, 2016).  This plan of action fails to address the stigma about everything being too privatised and not individual enough, where it needs to make Canary Wharf have a truly communally engaging and public individualistic identity.  But, as they themselves say in their 2016 sustainability report they are constantly evolving a ‘sense of place’, as they put it, and go on to say “…we’ll see not just Canary Wharf’s fabric, but its very character evolves as we move from a world-recognised commercial district into a genuine 24/7 city of the future.” (Hirigoyen, J. 2016, pg. 11). This report only tells us that they want to change, it does not mention any drastic change to the privatised state of the area or how they would make it have a more individualised relationship with its community. 
<br/>
		<br/>
Canary Wharf’s clean redevelopment, in 1988, was an ideal place for a Genoa type municipality to govern, and that is what has happened, but rather than a smart city they developed a corporate one, as was the style in the Thatcher era; even if Canary Wharf does look as if it was designed as a smart city. “… (Canary Wharf is) somewhere that feels as if a clever cyborg had scanned human cities and reconstituted their data into a three-dimensional reality” (Moore, R. 2016, Pg. 45). Not only in this statement does Moore tell us that the architecture looks robotically designed, as if it only has one use, but he is explaining that the design ideas for Canary Wharf could easily be broken down in to the data needed to build a city of this type, the parameters for the corporate language. I have said previously that it would be a good idea to design in a parametric systematic style, if you have the right type of data.  In this application of top-down design, the parameters are designed for the needs of the investors and the economy’s fluctuating state, not for the need of the public relations towards the city. Canary Wharf’s master planning language, by Skidmore, Owens & Merill, uses these techniques the same way the smart city implements these new technologies into the city presently; by sticking to the top-down analysis of the city, of how the design can help the country, economy, or advance technologies, and forgetting that people need to live in and enjoy the city.  Smart cities therefore are not the best or fastest way in which to develop an identity; or to edit an existing one, as is the case with Canary Wharf.   
<br/>
		<br/>
  The creative city is one of the better cities to understand the communal need, to which leads to a more engaging relationship with the community.  By engaging the creativity in people, it portrays their individuality on to the city. Making the city more attractive, through individuality, can be seen to attract more tourists and other creative, or individualistic people. This can be seen implemented later in a city’s identity through the introduction of new builds (as done in Brixton). But, would not work exceptionally well in Canary Wharf. This is due to its corporate owners and general affiliation with big business. The identity is already set, where if you were to introduce a design district, or any other creatively engaging hub, it would help, but would not change the lack of individuality in the area.  Due to the privatised nature and monochrome building around the Wharf, a new hub would keep people distracted from what is around them, but the area would not change to engage a relation with them.  “The people who use the wharf don’t seem too bothered by its possible lack of authenticity. The place makes physical the modern deal… most people accept it… Your life will be made pleasant and comfortable, with the help of diversions and stimulations that are well calculated and sometimes brilliantly calculated or charming, as long as you obey certain corporate rules, surrender some trivial freedoms and forget about asking how these things come to pass” (Moore, R. 2016. Pg. 45). I keep going back to the Orwellian aspects of the IoT being applied to the public. But, Canary Wharf is already somewhat in line with this idea of an authoritarian city, with private security constantly patrolling the area telling the public what they can and cannot do on its private land. It is important not to turn the state of privatising land an urban commonality. This hurts the individualised nature of one’s self, as, if the city can not be used freely, it can not boast to engage the public in its ‘inclusive growth’.

  Through this creative city, the bottom-up style of planning could be seen to counteract the top-down style forced upon the smart cities; by changing the uses of the technologies in the IoT, from managerial gatherers to more social gatherers. Taking ideas of humanistic individualism from the creative city and pairing it with the technologies and the top-down view of a data driven design for the city, it can become a fascinating and successful new urban design typology. When applied onto Canary Wharf as a mergence of the two, it would enhance the city’s individualism to a greater extent, thus creating an individual identity for the city.  Gathering individual, normal and real-time data from data gathering technologies throughout the city, would feedback to a main data storage unit. The data would be ready to be accessed by urban planners to analyse and mould the city under instructions from how people use the city rather than guessing what might be needed. Siemens have already developed a Facebook like data storage operating system (OS) to clearly lay out and connect the data from the city’s utilities; this is one of their products they are trying to sell to business with applicable IoT type assets. Called Mindsphere, this OS keeps control over these assets that might produce data that would efficiently allow you to save time and updates you with the assets real-time data (Figure 23) (Mindsphere at a Glance, 2017). An OS would be an important tool to organise the city after the implementation of these technologies; by taking data from new IoT type technologies, and existing data, such as reviews, social media engagement etc, to produce a profile of the area, and using these parameters that go into creating an improved city. In Canary Wharf’s case this OS and the implementation would help gather data of how people use the different areas and see what is needed to be introduced to the area to make it more engaging. This is how Canary Wharf should start to implement a new urban design strategy, which would help understand the communal need, and want, so it can co-exist with its already corporate identity and help to develop a communal one as well.

  	The creative city has the right set of principles that are integral for the city’s societal growth. Forgetting the creative portion for the moment, its ideologies of individualism is very important to the contemporary as bespoke is becoming the new modernity (as established in late 20th century with the post-modernism movement). The funky nuance of the individual architecture, sought to make the contextual landscape of the city seem unique and attractive. This is not just an outlook of the public but the urban planners, who think having a ‘starchitect’ to design an individualised building will make the city have a more attractive identity (as Bilbao can be seen to have done in the 1990s redevelopment of the area). The creative section of this urban design ideology is important for how the city may become individual. For creativity can easily be utilised as an individuality.  The creative city’s ideologies should be replicated to form the base of the city from which the contemporary theories of the smart city can grow.  
<br/>
		<br/>
The IoT and ICT’s are an important tool, just like any computational application, that can help the city get to know its occupants and find out more about how to settle or enhance its identity. But, the smart city is a style of development where the IoT is being used for purely pragmatically managerial applications. It does not find itself affecting the communal identity in a way which may stimulate the evolving societal paradigm that comes from this new era of ICT’s exponential growth. The way we use informatic technologies, to portray our personal identity via a set of data, able to be stored and accessed for all to view and use however we please, should be replicated on a bigger scale. We should use this same system of gathering identity data types to help grow our city’s identity; by using data gathering methods from the city as a tool to successfully implement all the data into the identity successfully.  This is where the architect comes in; not specifically a buildings designer but an architect in the definition that they would be able to understand and organise the variants of parameters that make up a city. This would be a new paradigm shift in the management of the city. And alongside, would take a lot of effort away from the managerial aspects of running the city, not just in the utilities infrastructures but also in the communal and public relations; by making the city more engaged with its occupants, forming new relationships and connections, networked around the uses of communicative technologies in the city.

When we apply these two cities separately to such a place as Canary Wharf we find that there is always a problematic issue. The corporate identity will always be in the way, and it is something we can not overcome by applying one or the other of these theories.  The creative city, with its important ideas of an individual city that engages with the community, is imperative to the success of a city but does not pose a way to be implemented into the city.  Thus, by creating a new urban development language together with the smart city - that seeks to collect data about the utilisation and the growth of the city – it helps display the city as an easily read set of instructions to be transformed and managed. The main question at the start of this dissertation was ‘how making a new urban design proposal would help canary wharf in its problematic corporate identity?’. But, after researching into the different strategies for the city, it became clear that the smart city was more about the nature of understanding the city, while the creative city was more about the humanistic theories of creating the city for the individual, which evolves with the community’s sense of place, and not the one imposed on them by the municipality, or higher ups. This lead to the realisation that all the city needs to succeed as an engaging network of growth is to have a better understanding of the sense of place, for which can keep track the public trends and needs in the area. For concluding on new urban strategies, the collection of multiple data types needs to have an operating system. The stored data utilising different types of algorithms to cross examine and filter the city’s data, to be analysed by the architect for strategically improving the city.
